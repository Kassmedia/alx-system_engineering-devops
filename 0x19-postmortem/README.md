Postmortem: Local Javascript File Not Found - New E-commerce Website Launch
Issue Summary:

Duration: 2 hours, Thursday, May 2nd, 2024 (PDT) 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
Impact: The newly launched e-commerce website experienced a critical issue where product images were not loading. Users attempting to browse products encountered a broken image icon for each product. This affected 100% of users visiting the site during the outage.
Root Cause: A missing semicolon at the end of a Javascript file path in the HTML code resulted in the browser failing to locate the image loading script.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: Monitoring alerts indicated a surge in failed image requests on the new e-commerce website.
10:10 AM: An engineer investigating the alerts noticed product images were not displaying.
10:10 AM - 11:00 AM: Initial investigation focused on potential server-side image storage issues or corrupted image files.
11:00 AM: Debugging shifted towards the front-end after server-side checks revealed no problems. The engineer examined the website's HTML code and discovered a missing semicolon at the end of the Javascript file path referencing the image loading script.
11:15 AM: The engineering team was notified and the issue was escalated.
11:30 AM: The missing semicolon was added to the HTML code, and the website was deployed again.
12:00 PM: The website functionality was restored, and product images loaded successfully.
Root Cause and Resolution:

A missing semicolon at the end of a Javascript file path within the website's HTML code caused the browser to misinterpret the path. This resulted in the image loading script not being found, leading to the broken image icon appearing for all product images.

The issue was resolved by adding the missing semicolon to the HTML code. Once redeployed, the browser was able to correctly locate the image loading script, and product images displayed as intended.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improved Code Review Process:
Implement a code review process that emphasizes syntax checks and adherence to best practices.
Utilize code linters or static code analysis tools to identify potential errors before deployment.
Enhanced Monitoring:
Expand monitoring to include checks for failed Javascript file loads on the client-side.
Implement alerts that trigger on abnormal spikes in failed resource requests.
Educational Resources:
Provide developers with additional resources on best practices for Javascript integration in HTML and the importance of proper code syntax.
Learning Points for Software Engineering Students:

This incident highlights the importance of meticulous code review and attention to detail.  A seemingly minor error like a missing semicolon can have a significant impact on website functionality.

Students should learn from this example by:

Understanding the importance of proper syntax: A single missing character can cause unexpected behavior.
Practicing code review: Developing a keen eye for detail and a habit of code review can help prevent such issues.
Utilizing developer tools: Browser developer tools offer valuable insights into website functionality and can aid in debugging front-end issues.

The Case of the Missing Semicolon: A Whodunit (and How We Fixed It)
Imagine this: You've just launched your brand new e-commerce website. You're brimming with excitement, visions of overflowing shopping carts dancing in your head. But then, disaster strikes!  Visitors are greeted with a barrage of broken image icons where your beautiful product photos should be.

The culprit? A sneaky little semicolon that went rogue, hiding in a line of code like a mischievous gremlin.

In this postmortem, we'll crack the case of the missing semicolon, revealing the hilarious culprit and how we wrangled it back into place.




The Crime Scene: A Semicolon Caper

The time: 10:00 AM PDT, Thursday, May 2nd, 2024. The place: Our shiny new e-commerce website. Our crack team of engineers noticed a surge in failed image requests.  Uh oh.

**Initially, we suspected a server-side storage issue, picturing gremlins corrupting our precious image files.  **But a quick investigation revealed our server was innocent.  The plot thickened!

With detective hats firmly on, we shifted our focus to the website's code.  After some code-combing, we unearthed the villain: a missing semicolon!  This tiny typo, like a misplaced comma in a love letter, caused the browser to completely misinterpret a path to our image loading script.  No script, no images - just a website full of broken hearts (or rather, broken image icons).

The Fix: A Semicolon Smackdown

The solution was as swift as it was simple: apprehend the missing semicolon and deliver it to its rightful place.  With a single keystroke, our hero (the engineer, not the semicolon) added the missing semicolon, and our website was back in business!

Lessons Learned: The Power of the Semicolon

This incident, while frustrating at the time,  serves as a hilarious reminder of the importance of code review and meticulous attention to detail.  A tiny typo can have a website-wide impact!
